OpenLDAP Kerberos 5 and personal secondary password support

This package provides support for a couple of features used in
OpenLDAP via that program dynamic load mechanism:

1) Kerberos 5 password validation when authenticating via bind.
   This is done by a provided dynamically loadable OpenLDAP
   authentication module.

2) Personal secondary passwords.
   In the event that user passwords are validated via Kerberos 5
   when authenticating via bind, this feature allows individual
   users to set an alternate password to be used instead. This
   feature is provided via a couple of dynamically loadable
   OpenLDAP authentication modules along with a program to set
   the alternate password hash. 

Both of these features require that modules support is available
in OpenLDAP (via the '--enable-modules' option during build).
